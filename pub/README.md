  The majority of the settings are customizable, you can change the radius, starting location, text to present, color, and a lot more. 
  
  The library is suitable for both beginners and advanced users, all the default value (except the canvas) are pre-setted (see documentation page for detail), and can be changed!

After clicking on canvas, the points will start to bounce around inside the canvas!

Clicking more than once will result in the points to accelerate.
