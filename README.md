## Project Name : Animation Enrichment Bundle (AEB)

#### The website is : [Animation Enrichment Bundle](https://yhuang1berta.github.io/Animation_Enrichment_Bundle/pub/index.html)

## Introduction
  This library's primary function is to plot text with points on any canvas object and let the user interact with those points by utilizes the canvas element and javascript's animation feature.

  The majority of the settings are customizable, you can change the radius, starting location, text to present, color, and a lot more. 
  
  The library is suitable for both beginners and advanced users, all the default value (except the canvas) are pre-setted (see documentation page for detail), and can be changed!
  
## Text Fall Animation
Ploting the passed in text using points on canvas.

After clicking on canvas, the points will start to bounce around inside the canvas!

Clicking more than once will result in the points to accelerate.
